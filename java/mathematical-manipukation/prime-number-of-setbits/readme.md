# Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation

### Find the problem [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-number-of-set-bits-in-binary-representation/) 

### Problem statement
Given two integers left and right, find the count of numbers in the range [left, right] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present when written in binary. For example, 21 written in binary is 10101 which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)
